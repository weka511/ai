	title = {The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple},
	abstract = {This paper provides a concise description of the free energy principle, starting from a formulation of random dynamical systems in terms of a Langevin equation and ending with a Bayesian mechanics that can be read as a physics of sentience. It rehearses the key steps using standard results from statistical physics. These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408},
	abstract = {We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle, and highlight some technical issues. We discuss how these issues aﬀect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences to newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various deﬁnitions of the “Markov blanket” proposed in diﬀerent works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexample that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not suﬃciently justiﬁed. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parameterised by diﬀerent variables than in older works, leading to a substantially diﬀerent interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some speciﬁc problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the relationship between thermodynamics, information and inference. In particular, it explores the thermodynamic concomitants of belief updating, under a variational (free energy) principle for self-organization. In brief, any (weakly mixing) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket—i.e. a separation of internal and external states—is equipped with an information geometry. This means that internal states parametrize a probability density over external states. Furthermore, at non-equilibrium steady-state, the flow of internal states can be construed as a gradient flow on a quantity known in statistics as Bayesian model evidence. In short, there is a natural Bayesian mechanics for any system that possesses a Markov blanket. Crucially, this means that there is an explicit link between the inference performed by internal states and their energetics—as characterized by their stochastic thermodynamics.
